After 730 days of loving you it feels like I have learned so much about what it means to truly love someone and need them in my life. I love that every fight, however few they are, makes us stronger and love each other better than before. I love that we can spend hours just being silly not doing anything at all and it never gets old. I love how you bother me relentlessly even though I pretend that I hate it. I know that is has been a tough couple of months for me and that has been hard on you, but the one thing I am confident about in my life is you. I know that I have chosen my person for life and I couldn't imagine doing life with anyone else. I love you and everything about you and I cannot wait to see us grow together in life. I wouldn't be the man I am today without you and I am forever grateful for you. I love you Mya!"
